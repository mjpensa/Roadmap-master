## Dependencies

**CRITICAL PATH:**
1. Vendor assessment **must be completed** before User Acceptance Testing begins
2. User Acceptance Testing **depends on** completion of vendor assessment
3. Compliance review **must be complete** before regulatory submission
4. Regulatory approval **required** before go-live
5. OCC approval **depends on** submission of complete documentation

**PARALLEL ACTIVITIES:**
- Core integration can begin while UAT is in progress
- Security assessment runs concurrently with compliance review

## Risk Factors

### High-Risk Items:
1. **Legacy system integration** - COBOL mainframe migration is untested in our environment
2. **Customer impact during cutover** - Risk of transaction disruptions during weekend switchover
3. **Data migration complexity** - 30 years of historical data requires careful validation
4. **Third-party vendor dependency** - Reliance on vendor for critical migration tools
5. **Manual workaround processes** - Temporary manual procedures during transition period

### Compliance Risks:
- BSA (Bank Secrecy Act) reporting continuity
- AML (Anti-Money Laundering) system integration
- KYC (Know Your Customer) data accuracy
- OFAC sanctions screening during migration

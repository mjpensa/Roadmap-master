# Semantic Overlay Engine - Executive Brief
## Strategic Intelligence Enhancement for Banking Consultancy

---

## 🎯 Business Value Proposition

### The Problem
Banking executives are drowning in AI-generated insights but cannot distinguish between:
- **Facts**: Information explicitly stated in documents (100% verifiable)
- **Inferences**: AI-derived conclusions (varying confidence levels)

This uncertainty creates **decision paralysis** and **regulatory risk** when presenting to C-suite executives and banking clients.

### The Solution: Semantic Overlay Engine
A **deterministic AI system** that clearly separates facts from inferences, providing:
- **Toggle Switch Control**: Executives can instantly switch between "Facts Only" and "AI-Enhanced" views
- **Confidence Scoring**: Every inference has a transparent confidence percentage
- **Source Attribution**: Every fact links to its exact source quote
- **Banking Intelligence**: Regulatory deadlines and compliance requirements automatically detected
